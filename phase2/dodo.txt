fix the flex file so it returns TOKENS where it used to just print stuff...

precedence

%tokens arrangement

%types for values arrays

associativity for function calls and array

when handling numbers should it return a NUMBER token && do we modify yylval to hold the data like atoi(yytext)?

what about the UMINUS should that be done the same way as the lab2 calculator?

should IDENTIFIER be a token now? ( how will it know something is and id name, for now i put a temp ID token on its own line )

should there be the END token returned after newlines? ( i put it as a a separate token on its own line right now... )

currently tokens are split up by group: keyword, math, logic, symbol, end

what to do about READ/WRITE is that just using cin/cout?
