it appears as though the syntax of Mini-L has changed at some point (possibly multiple times).
some of the examples of .min programs contain different keywords.

new specification tokens:
    FUNCTION, BEGIN_PARAMS, END_PARAMS, BEGIN_LOCALS, END_LOCALS, BEGIN_BODY, END_BODY

older specification tokens: (no longer present)
    PROGRAM, BEGIN_PROGRAM, END_PROGRAM, BREAK, EXIT, QUESTION

another possible old token: (no longer present)
    FOREACH
