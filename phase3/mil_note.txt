The MIL interpreter assumes the following about a MIL program:

1. Each line in the MIL file contains at most one MIL instruction
2. Each line is at most 254 characters long
3. All variables are defined before they are used
4. Functions begin with a line of the form "func name" and end with the line "endfunc"

Functions in the MIL language:

Functions in the MIL language start with a line of the form "func name" and end with the line "endfunc".
Parameters are passed to mil functions with the param command, and values are returned from functions.
Inside functions, arguments are referenced using a positional notation.
For example, the first argument specified with the param instruction prior to the current function call would be accessible as the name $0.
All arguments are passed by value, and recursive function calls are supported.
A semantically valid MIL program must contain a function named main.
All functions (with the exception of main) must return a scalar value.
The main function must not return any value.

#----------------------------------------

the "=" is used in statement for ASSIGN, and maybe var


not sure how to tell when read/write to scalar/array
