Notes on phase3 version 2 based on t paynes compiler

i think i have fixed some things, but other stuff is broken.

----------------------------------------

variable declarations: (fixed)

the last part of the "Decl" statement is broken.
if declare a list of scalars it will set the first scalar as array, but the others are scalars

this declare
j,k : integer

becomes this mil code
. k
.[] j, 0

this is the specific rule

    | ID ',' Decl                           // right recursion *
        {
            rules << "VectorDec. ->  ID ',' VectorDecl \n";
            code  << ".[] " << *($1) << ", " << vectorSize << "\n"; // this will declare scalars in a list as array
        }

fix by changing the rule to scalars only.
in the example tests never saw a list of arrays, only lists of scalars

code << ". " << *$1 << "\n";

----------------------------------------

use without declare error: (fixed)

in some operations it will
then it creates a temp variable, but doesnt output the declaration.
then it uses to the temp. this causes an error of using an undeclared variable.

Error: Use of undeclared variable _T0

fix by adding a declaration after each temp is made

$$ = new string("_T" + to_string(reductionCt++));
code << ". " << *$$ << "\n";                        // add this to declare temp

----------------------------------------

function parameter declarations: (fixed)

in a function declaration need to declare parameters and then set to the position arguments
this is done by adding 2 new rules beginparams and endparams which set a bool.
then in the Decl rule it checks whether the params bool is true


beginparams
    : BEGINPARAMS
        {
            pdec_flag = true;
        }
      ;

endparams
    : ENDPARAMS
        {
            pdec_flag = false; // set flag to done with params
        }
    ;

inside the Decl rule add a check for the bool, only for scalars (parameters are scalars)

    if(pdec_flag == true)
    {
        code << "= " << *$1 << ", $" << pnum_cnt << "\n";
        pnum_cnt++;
    }

----------------------------------------

function calls: (broken)

in function calls need to handle passing parameters
but there is an error with the rule where ExpList causes a syntax error.

ID '(' ExpList ')' // syntax error will not compile...

change to

ID '(' Exp ')'

this works and $3 is the parameter, but now ExpList is useless, also can't do multiple params

----------------------------------------

the last things left are

branches
    if
    if/else

loops
    while
    do while

continue
